# Constructors With Default Arguments In C++
## Constructors with Default Arguments in C++
Default arguments of the constructor are those which are provided in the constructor declaration. If the values are not provided when calling the constructor the constructor uses the default arguments automatically. An example program to demonstrate the concept default arguments in C++ is shown below.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Simple{
    int data1;
    int data2;
    int data3;

    public:
        Simple(int a, int b=9, int c=8){
            data1 = a;
            data2 = b;
            data3 = c;
        }

        void printData();

};

void Simple :: printData(){
    cout<<"The value of data1, data2 and data3 is "<<data1<<", "<< data2<<" and "<< data3<<endl;
}
```
As shown in above code,

- 1st we created a “simple” class which consists of private data members “data1”, “data2” and “data3”.
- 2nd parameterized constructor of the “simple” class is defined which takes three parameters and assigns values to the data members “a” and “b”. The main thing to note here is that the value “9” and “8” are the default values for the variables “b” and “c”.
- 3rd function “printData” is defined which prints the values of the data members “data1”, “data2”, and “data3”.
- The main program is shown below.
```cpp
int main(){
    Simple s(12, 13);
    s.printData();
    return 0;
}
```
- st parameterized constructor is called with the object “s” of the data type “simple” and the values “12” and “13” are passed. The main thing to note here is that the value of the parameter “c” will be automatically set by the default value.
- 2nd function “printData” is called which will print the values of data members.
# Dynamic Initialization of Objects Using Constructors 
## Dynamic Initialization of Objects Using Constructors
The dynamic initialization of the object means that the object is initialized at the runtime.  Dynamic initialization of the object using a constructor is beneficial when the data is of different formats. An example program is shown below to demonstrate the concept of dynamic initialization of objects using constructors.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;


class BankDeposit{
    int principal;
    int years;
    float interestRate;
    float returnValue;

    public:
        BankDeposit(){}
        BankDeposit(int p, int y, float r); // r can be a value like 0.04
        BankDeposit(int p, int y, int r); // r can be a value like 14
        void show();
};
```
As shown in above Code,

- 1st we created a “BankDeposit” class which consists of private data members “principal”, “years”, “interestRate”, and “returnValue”.
- 2nd default constructor of the “BankDeposit” class is declared.
- 3rd parameterized constructor of the “BankDeposit” class is declared which takes three parameters “p”, “y”, and “r”. The main thing to note here is that the parameter “r” is of a float data type.
- 4th parameterized constructor of the “BankDeposit” class is declared which takes three parameters “p”, “y”, and “r”. The main thing to note here is that the parameter “r” is of an integer data type.
- 5th function “show” is declared.
- The definition of constructors and function is shown below.
```cpp
BankDeposit :: BankDeposit(int p, int y, float r)
{
    principal = p;
    years = y;
    interestRate = r;
    returnValue = principal;
    for (int i = 0; i < y; i++)
    {
        returnValue = returnValue * (1+interestRate);
    }
}

BankDeposit :: BankDeposit(int p, int y, int r)
{
    principal = p;
    years = y;
    interestRate = float(r)/100;
    returnValue = principal;
    for (int i = 0; i < y; i++)
    {
        returnValue = returnValue * (1+interestRate);
    }
}

void BankDeposit :: show(){
    cout<<endl<<"Principal amount was "<<principal
        << ". Return value after "<<years
        << " years is "<<returnValue<<endl;
}
```
As shown in above Code,

- 1st the constructor “BankDeposit” is defined in which the value of the parameter “p” is assigned to the data member “principal”; the value of the parameter “y” is assigned to the data member “year”; the value of the parameter “r” is assigned to the data member “interestRate”. At the end “for” loop is defined which will run till the length of the variable “y” and add “1” in the “interestRate”; then multiply the value with the “returnValue”. The main thing to note here is that in this constructor the data type of the parameter “r” is float.
- 2nd another constructor “BankDeposit” is defined in which the value of the parameter “p” is assigned to the data member “principal”; the value of the parameter “y” is assigned to the data member “year”; the value of the parameter “r” is converted to “float” and divided by “100” then assigned to the data member “interestRate”. At the end “for” loop is defined which will run till the length of the variable “y” and add “1” in the “interestRate”; then multiply the value with the “returnValue”. The main thing to note here is that in this constructor the data type of the parameter “r” is float.
- 3rd the function “show” is defined which will print the values of the data members “principal”, “year”, and “returnValue”.
The main program is shown below.
```cpp
int main(){
    BankDeposit bd1, bd2, bd3;
    int p, y;
    float r;
    int R;
    
    
    cout<<"Enter the value of p y and r"<<endl;
    cin>>p>>y>>r;
    bd1 = BankDeposit(p, y, r);
    bd1.show();

    cout<<"Enter the value of p y and R"<<endl;
    cin>>p>>y>>R;
    bd2 = BankDeposit(p, y, R);
    bd2.show();
    return 0;
}
```
As shown in above code,

- 1st the object “bd1”, “bd2”, and “bd3” of the data type “BankDeposit” are created.
- 2nd the integer variables “p” and “y” are declared; the float variable “r” is declared, and the integer variable “R” is declared.
- 3rd the values for the variables “p”, “y”, and”r” are taken from the user on the runtime.
- 4th parameterized constructor “BankDeposit” is called with the object “bd1” and the variables “p”, “y”, and “r” are passed. The main thing to note here is that this will run the constructor with float parameters “r”.
- 5th function “show” is called which will print the values of data members
- 6th the values for the variables “p”, “y”, and ”R” are taken from the user on the runtime.
- 7th parameterized constructor “BankDeposit” is called with the object “bd2” and the variables “p”, “y”, and “R” are passed. The main thing to note here is that this will run the constructor with integer parameters “R”.
- 8th function “show” is called which will print the values of data members.
# Copy Constructor in C++
## Copy Constructor in C++
A copy constructor is a type of constructor that creates a copy of another object. If we want one object to resemble another object we can use a copy constructor. If no copy constructor is written in the program compiler will supply its own copy constructor. An example program to demonstrate the concept of a Copy constructor in C++ is shown below.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;


class Number{
    int a;
    public:
        Number(){
            a = 0;
        }

        Number(int num){
            a = num;
        }
        // When no copy constructor is found, compiler supplies its own copy constructor
        Number(Number &obj){
            cout<<"Copy constructor called!!!"<<endl;
            a = obj.a;
        }

        void display(){
            cout<<"The number for this object is "<< a <<endl;
        }
};
```

As shown in above Code,

- 1st we created a “number” class which consists of private data member “a”.
- 2nd default constructor of the “number” class is defined which has no parameters and assign “0” to the data members “a”.
- 3rd parameterized constructor of the “number” class is defined which takes one parameter and assigns values to the data members “a”.
- 4th copy constructor of the “number” class is defined which takes its own reference object as a parameter and assigns values to the data members “a”.
- 5th function “display” is defined which will print the values of the data members “a”.
The main program is shown below in.
```cpp
int main(){
    Number x, y, z(45), z2;
    x.display();
    y.display();
    z.display();

    Number z1(z); // Copy constructor invoked
    z1.display();

    z2 = z; // Copy constructor not called
    z2.display();

    Number z3 = z; // Copy constructor invoked
    z3.display();

    // z1 should exactly resemble z  or x or y

    return 0;
}
```


As shown in above Code,

- 1st objects “x”, “y”, “z”, and “z1” are created of the “number” data type. The main thing to note here is that the object “z” has a value “45”.
- 2nd function “display” is called by the objects “x”, “y”, and “z”.
- 3rd copy constructor is invoked and the object “z” is passed to “z1”
- 4th function “display” is called by the object “z1”
- 5th the value of “z” is assigned to “z1”. The main thing to note here is that it will not invoke a copy constructor because the object “z” is already created.
- 6th function “display” is called by the object “z2”
- 7th the value of “z” is assigned to “z3”. The main thing to note here is that it will invoke a copy constructor because the object “z3” is being created.
- 8th function “display” is called by the object “z3”
