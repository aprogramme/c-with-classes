# C++ Objects Memory Allocation & using Arrays in Classes 


# Objects Memory Allocation in C++
- The way memory is allocated to variables and functions of the class is different even though they both are from the same class.

- The memory is only allocated to the variables of the class when the object is created. The memory is not allocated to the variables when the class is declared. At the same time, single variables can have different values for different objects, so every object has an individual copy of all the variables of the class. But the memory is allocated to the function only once when the class is declared. So the objects don’t have individual copies of functions only one copy is shared among each object.
# Arrays in Classes
Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type. An array is very helpful when multiple variables are required, instead of making multiple variables one array can be used which can store multiple values. Array stores data in sequential order. An example program to demonstrate the use of arrays in classes is shown below.
```cpp
class Shop
{
    int itemId[100];
    int itemPrice[100];
    int counter;

public:
    void initCounter(void) { counter = 0; }
    void setPrice(void);
    void displayPrice(void);
};
```
As shown in above Code, we created a shop class which has, “itemId[100]” and “itemPrice” as integer array variable and “counter” variable as private class members; and “initCounter” void function, “setPrice” void function, and “displayPrice” void function as public class members. The definitions of these functions are shown below.
```cpp
void Shop ::setPrice(void)
{
    cout << "Enter Id of your item no " << counter + 1 << endl;
    cin >> itemId[counter];
    cout << "Enter Price of your item" << endl;
    cin >> itemPrice[counter];
    counter++;
}
```
As shown in Code above, we have created a “setPrice” function. This function will take input for “itemId” and “ItemPrice” from the user at runtime. The value of the counter will be incremented by one every time this function will run.
```cpp
void Shop ::displayPrice(void)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < counter; i++)
    {
        cout << "The Price of item with Id " << itemId[i] << " is " << itemPrice[i] << endl;
    }
}
```
As shown in above Code, the “for” loop inside the “displayPrice” function runs till the length of the counter and prints values of the array “itemId” and “ItemPrice”.
```cpp
int main()
{
    Shop dukaan;
    dukaan.initCounter();
    dukaan.setPrice();
    dukaan.setPrice();
    dukaan.setPrice();
    dukaan.displayPrice();
    return 0;
}
```
As shown in Code above, we created an object “dukaan” of the shop data type, and the functions “initCounter” is called. The function “setPrice” is called three times. Loops can also be used to call the function multiple times. The “displayPrice” function is also called in the main function.
# Code 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shop
{
    int itemId[100];
    int itemPrice[100];
    int counter;

public:
    void initCounter(void) { counter = 0; }
    void setPrice(void);
    void displayPrice(void);
};

void Shop ::setPrice(void)
{
    cout << "Enter Id of your item no " << counter + 1 << endl;
    cin >> itemId[counter];
    cout << "Enter Price of your item" << endl;
    cin >> itemPrice[counter];
    counter++;
}

void Shop ::displayPrice(void)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < counter; i++)
    {
        cout << "The Price of item with Id " << itemId[i] << " is " << itemPrice[i] << endl;
    }
}

int main()
{
    Shop dukaan;
    dukaan.initCounter();
    dukaan.setPrice();
    dukaan.setPrice();
    dukaan.setPrice();
    dukaan.displayPrice();
    return 0;
}
```
