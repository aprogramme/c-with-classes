# Output Instruction

1. In c, standard output device is monitor and printf() is used to send data/message to monitor.

2. printf() is a predefined function.

3. In c++, we can use cout to send data/message to monitor.

4. cout is a predefined object.

5. The operator << is called the insertion or put to operator.

@ in c, printf("Hello SCA");

  in c++, cout<<"Hello SCA";

@  in c, printf("Sum of %d and %d is %d ", a, b, c);

  in c++, cout<<"sum of"<<a<<" and "<<b<<" is "<<c;

@ in c, printf("%d", a+b);

  in c++, cout<<a+b;










# Input Instruction

1. In c standard input device is keyboard and scanf() is use to receive data from keyboard.

2. scanf() is a prdefined function.

3. In c++, we can use cin to input dara from keyboard.

4. The identifier cin is a predefined object in c++.

5. The operator >> is known as extraction ir get from operator.

@ in c, scanf("%d", &a);
  
  in c++, cin>>a;

@ in c, scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);

in c++, cin>>a>>b;

@ in c, scanf("%d %f", &a, &c);

in c++, cin>>a>>c;


6. According to ANSI standard for c language, explicit declaration of function is recommended but not mandatory.

7. ANSI standard for C++ language say explicit declaration of function is compulsory.
