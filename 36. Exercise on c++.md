# Exercise on C++ Inheritance:
## Questions
 You have to create 2 classes:

1. SimpleCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs +, -, *, / and displays the results using another function.
2. ScientificCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs any four scientific operation of your chioice and displays the results using another function.
3, Create another class HybridCalculator and inherit it using these 2 classes.

 Also, answer the questions given below.

- What type of Inheritance are you using?
- Which mode of Inheritance are you using?
- Create an object of HybridCalculator and display results of simple and scientific calculator.
- How is code reusability implemented?
 ```cpp
 #include<iostream>
using namespace std;
/*
Create 2 classes:
    1. SimpleCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs +, -, *, / and displays the results using another function.
    2. ScientificCalculator - Takes input of 2 numbers using a utility function and performs any four scientific operations of your choice and displays the results using another function.

    Create another class HybridCalculator and inherit it using these 2 classes:
    Q1. What type of Inheritance are you using?
    Q2. Which mode of Inheritance are you using?
    Q3. Create an object of HybridCalculator and display results of the simple and scientific calculator.
    Q4. How is code reusability implemented?

int main(){
    
    return 0;
}
```
## Solution

So the question was to make three classes “SimpleCalculator”, “ScientificCalculator” and “HybridCalculator”.

- In “SimpleCalculator” class you have to take input of 2 numbers and perform function (+, -, *, /)
- In “ScientificCalculator” class you have to take input of 2 numbers and perform any 4 scientific operations
- You have to inherit both “SimpleCalculator” and “ScientificCalculator” classes with the “HybridCalculator” class. You have to make an object of the “HybridCalculator” class and display the results of “SimpleCalculator” and “ScientificCalculator” classes.
The solution to the above Question is shown below,
```cpp
class SimpleCalculator {
    int a, b;
    public:
        void getDataSimple()
        {
            cout<<"Enter the value of a"<<endl;
            cin>>a;
            cout<<"Enter the value of b"<<endl;
            cin>>b;
        }

        void performOperationsSimple(){
            cout<<"The value of a + b is: "<<a + b<<endl;
            cout<<"The value of a - b is: "<<a - b<<endl;
            cout<<"The value of a * b is: "<<a * b<<endl;
            cout<<"The value of a / b is: "<<a / b<<endl;
        }
};
```
As shown in above code,

- We created a class “SimpleCalculator” which contains two private data members “a” and “b”
- The class “SimpleCalculator” contains two member functions “getDataSimple” and “performOperationsSimple”
- The function “getDataSimple” will take 2 numbers as input
- The function “performOperationsSimple” will perform the operations “+, -, *, /”
```cpp
class ScientificCalculator{
    int a, b;

    public:
        void getDataScientific()
        {
            cout << "Enter the value of a" << endl;
            cin >> a;
            cout << "Enter the value of b" << endl;
            cin >> b;
        }

        void performOperationsScientific()
        { 
            cout << "The value of cos(a) is: " << cos(a) << endl;
            cout << "The value of sin(a) is: " << sin(a) << endl;
            cout << "The value of exp(a) is: " << exp(a) << endl;
            cout << "The value of tan(a) is: " << tan(a) << endl;
        }
};
```
As shown in above code,

- We created a class “ScientificCalculator” which contains two private data members “a” and “b”
- The class “ScientificCalculator” contains two member functions “getDataScientific” and “performOperationsScientific”
- The function “getDataScientific” will take 2 numbers as input
- The function “performOperationsScientific” will perform the operations “cos, sin, exp, tan”
```cpp
class HybridCalculator : public SimpleCalculator, public ScientificCalculator{
    
};
```
As shown in above code, we created a “HybridCalculator” class which is inheriting the “SimpleCalculator” class and “ScientificCalculator” class.
```cpp
int main()
{
    HybridCalculator calc;
    calc.getDataScientific();
    calc.performOperationsScientific();
    calc.getDataSimple();
    calc.performOperationsSimple();
    
    return 0;
}
```
As shown in above code,

- We created an object “calc” of the data type “hybridCalculator”
- The function “getDataScientific” is called using the object “calc”
- The function “performOperationsScientific” is called using the object “calc”
- The function “getDataSimple” is called using the object “calc”
- The function “performOperationsSimple” is called using the object “calc”

Q1. What type of Inheritance are you using?

Ans. Multiple inheritances

Q2. Which mode of Inheritance are you using?

Ans. public SimpleCalculator, public ScientificCalculator
