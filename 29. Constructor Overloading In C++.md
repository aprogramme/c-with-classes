# Constructor Overloading In C++
## Constructor Overloading in C++
Constructor overloading is a concept in which one class can have multiple constructors with different parameters. The main thing to note here is that the constructors will run according to the arguments for example if a program consists of 3 constructors with 0, 1, and 2 arguments, so if we pass 1 argument to the constructor the compiler will automatically run the constructor which is taking 1 argument. An example program to demonstrate the concept of Constructor overloading in C++ is shown below.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex
{
    int a, b;

public:
    Complex(){
        a = 0;
        b =0;
    }

    Complex(int x, int y)
    {
        a = x;
        b = y;
    }

    Complex(int x){
        a = x;
        b = 0;
    }

  

    void printNumber()
    {
        cout << "Your number is " << a << " + " << b << "i" << endl;
    }
};
```
As shown in above Code,

- 1st we created a “complex” class which consists of private data members “a” and “b”.
- 2nd default constructor of the “complex” class is declared which has no parameters and assigns “0” to the data members “a” and “b”.
- 3rd parameterized constructor of the “complex” class is declared which takes two parameters and assigns values to the data members “a” and “b”.
- 4th parameterized constructor of the “complex” class is declared which takes one parameter and assigns values to the data members “a” and “b”.
- 5th function “printNumber” is defined which will print the values of the data members “a” and “b”.
```cpp
int main()
{
    Complex c1(4, 6);
    c1.printNumber();

    Complex c2(5);
    c2.printNumber();

    Complex c3;
    c3.printNumber();
    return 0;
}
```
As shown in above Code,

- 1st parameterized constructor is called with the object “c1” and the values “4” and “6” are passed. The main thing to note here is that this will run the constructor with two parameters.
- 2nd function “printNumber” is called which will print the values of data members
- 3rd parameterized constructor is called with the object “c2” and the value “5” is passed. The main thing to note here is that this will run the constructor with one parameter.
- 4th function “printNumber” is called which will print the values of data members
- 5th default constructor is called with the object “c3”. The main thing to note here is that this will run the constructor with no parameters.
- 6th function “printNumber” is called which will print the values of data members
## Constructors with Default Arguments in C++
Default arguments of the constructor are those which are provided in the constructor declaration. If the values are not provided when calling the constructor the constructor uses the default arguments automatically. An example program to demonstrate the concept default arguments in C++ is shown below.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class Simple{
    int data1;
    int data2;
    int data3;

    public:
        Simple(int a, int b=9, int c=8){
            data1 = a;
            data2 = b;
            data3 = c;
        }

        void printData();

};

void Simple :: printData(){
    cout<<"The value of data1, data2 and data3 is "<<data1<<", "<< data2<<" and "<< data3<<endl;
}
```
As shown in above code,

- 1st we created a “simple” class which consists of private data members “data1”, “data2” and “data3”.
- 2nd parameterized constructor of the “simple” class is defined which takes three parameters and assigns values to the data members “a” and “b”. The main thing to note here is that the value “9” and “8” are the default values for the variables “b” and “c”.
- 3rd function “printData” is defined which prints the values of the data members “data1”, “data2”, and “data3”.
```cpp
int main(){
    Simple s(12, 13);
    s.printData();
    return 0;
}
```
As shown in above code,

- 1st parameterized constructor is called with the object “s” of the data type “simple” and the values “12” and “13” are passed. The main thing to note here is that the value of the parameter “c” will be automatically set by the default value.
- 2nd function “printData” is called which will print the values of data members.
