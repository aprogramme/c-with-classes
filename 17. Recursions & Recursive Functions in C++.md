# Recursions & Recursive Functions in C++
When a function calls itself it is called recursion and the function which is calling itself is called a recursive function. The recursive function consists of a base case and recursive condition. It is very important to add a base case in recursive function otherwise recursive function will never stop executing. An example of the recursive function is shown in below Code.
```cpp
int factorial(int n){
    if (n<=1){
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n-1);
}
```
As shown in above Code, we created a “factorial” function which takes one argument. In the function body, there is a base case which checks that if the value of variable “n” is smaller or equal to “1” if the condition is “true” return “1”. And there is a recursive condition that divides the bigger value to smaller values and at the end returns a factorial. These are the steps which will be performed by recursive condition:

- 4 * factorial( 4-1 )
- 4 * 3 * factorial( 3-1 )
- 4* 3 * 2 * factorial( 2-1 )
- 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
An example to pass the value to the recursive factorial function is shown in below Code.
```cpp
int main(){
    int a;
    cout<<"Enter a number"<<endl;
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"The factorial of "<<a<< " is "<<factorial(a)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
- Another example of a recursive function for the Fibonacci series is shown in below Code.
```cpp
int fib(int n){
    if(n<2){
        return 1;
    }
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1);
}
```
As shown in above Code, wAs shown in Code Snippet 3, we created a “fib” function which takes one argument. In the function body, there is a base case which checks that if the value of variable “n” is smaller than “2”, if the condition is “true” return “1”. And there is a recursive condition that divides the bigger value to smaller values and at the end returns a Fibonacci number. An example to pass the value to the Fibonacci function is shown in below Code.
```cpp
int main(){
    int a;
    cout<<"Enter a number"<<endl;
    cin>>a;
    cout<<"The term in fibonacci sequence at position "<<a<< " is "<<fib(a)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
As shown in above Code, we created an integer variable “a”, which takes input at the runtime and that value is passed to the Fibonacci function.
```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int fib(int n){
    if(n<2){
        return 1;
    }
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1);
}

// fib(5)
// fib(4) + fib(3)
// fib(2) + fib(3) + fib(2) + fib(3)

int factorial(int n){
    if (n<=1){
        return 1;
    }
    return n * factorial(n-1);
}

// Step by step calculation of factorial(4)
// factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(3); 
// factorial(4) = 4 * 3 * factorial(2);
// factorial(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1);
// factorial(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1;
// factorial(4) = 24;

int main(){
    // Factorial of a number:
    // 6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1 = 720
    // 0! = 1 by definition
    // 1! = 1 by definition
    // n! = n * (n-1)!
    int a;
    cout<<"Enter a number"<<endl;
    cin>>a;
    // cout<<"The factorial of "<<a<< " is "<<factorial(a)<<endl;
    cout<<"The term in fibonacci sequence at position "<<a<< " is "<<fib(a)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
