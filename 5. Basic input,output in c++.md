# Basic Input/Output in C++

C++ language comes with different libraries, which helps us in performing input/output operations. In C++ sequence of bytes corresponding to input and output are commonly known as streams. There are two types of streams:

# Input stream:
In the input stream, the direction of the flow of bytes occurs from the input device (for ex keyboard) to the main memory.

# Output stream:
In output stream, the direction of flow of bytes occurs from main memory to the output device (for ex-display)

- Important Points
1. The sign "<<" is called insertion operator
2. The sign ">>" is called extraction operator
3. "cout" keyword is used to print
4. "cin" keyword is used to take input at run time.
# Reserved keywords in C++
Reserved keywords are those keywords that are used by the language itself, which is why these keywords are not available for re-definition or overloading. In short, you cannot create variables with these names.
# Code:
```cpp
# include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num1, num2;
    cout<<"Enter the value of num1:\n"; /* '<<' is called Insertion operator */
    cin>>num1; /* '>>' is called Extraction operator */

    cout<<"Enter the value of num2:\n"; /* '<<' is called Insertion operator */
    cin>>num2; /* '>>' is called Extraction operator */

    cout<<"The sum is "<< num1+num2;

    return 0;
}
```
- In this piece of code, we have declared two integer variables "num1" and "num2". Firstly we used "cout" to print "Enter the value of num1:" as it is on the screen, and then we used "cin" to take the input in "num1" at run time from the user.

- Secondly, we used "cout" to print "Enter the value of num2:" as it is on the screen, and then we used "cin" to take the input in "num2" at run time from the user.

- In the end, we used "cout" to print "The sum is" as it is on the screen and also gave the literal "num1+num2" which will add the values of both variables and print it on the screen.
