# Multilevel Inheritance:
## Multilevel Inheritance in C++
Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in which one derived class is inherited from another derived class. For example, we have three classes “animal”, “mammal” and “cow”. If the “mammal” class is inherited from the “animal” class and “cow” class is inherited from “mammal” which means that the “mammal” class can now implement the functionalities of “animal” and “cow” class can now implement the functionalities of “mammal” class.

An example program is shown below to demonstrate the concept of multilevel inheritance in C++.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student
{
protected:
    int roll_number;

public:
    void set_roll_number(int);
    void get_roll_number(void);
};

void Student ::set_roll_number(int r)
{
    roll_number = r;
}

void Student ::get_roll_number()
{
    cout << "The roll number is " << roll_number << endl;
}
```
As shown in above,

- 1st we created a “student” class which consists of protected data member integer “roll_number”.
- 2nd the “student” class consists of a public function “set_roll_number” and “get_roll_number”
- 3rd the function “set_roll_number” will set the value of the data member “roll_number”.
- 4th the function “get_roll_number” will print the value of the data member “roll_number”.
The code for the “exam” class is shown below which is inheriting the “student” class
```cpp
class Exam : public Student
{
protected:
    float maths;
    float physics;

public:
    void set_marks(float, float);
    void get_marks(void);
};

void Exam ::set_marks(float m1, float m2)
{
    maths = m1;
    physics = m2;
}

void Exam ::get_marks()
{
    cout << "The marks obtained in maths are: " << maths << endl;
    cout << "The marks obtained in physics are: " << physics << endl;
}
```
As shown in Code above code,

- 1st we created an “exam” class that is inheriting “student” class in public mode.
- 2nd the “exam” class consists of protected data members float “math” and float “physics”.
- 3rd the “exam” class consists of public member functions “set_marks” and “get_marks”.
- 4th the function “set_marks” will set the value of the data members “math” and “physics”.
- 5th the function “get_marks” will print the value of the data members “math” and “physics”.
The code for the “result” class is shown below which is inheriting the “exam” class
```cpp
class Result : public Exam
{
    float percentage;

public:
    void display_results()
    {
        get_roll_number();
        get_marks();
        cout << "Your result is " << (maths + physics) / 2 << "%" << endl;
    }
};
```
As shown in above code,

- 1st we created a “Result” class which is inheriting the “Exam” class in public mode.
- 2nd the “Result” class consists of private data member’s float “percentage”.
- 3rd the “exam” class consists of the public member function “display_results”.
- 4th the function “display_results” will call the “get_roll_number” and “get_marks” functions, and add the values of “math” and “physics” variables then divide that value with “2” to get a percentage and prints it.
- It can be clearly seen that the class “Exam” is inheriting class “student” and class “Results” is inheriting class “Exam”; which is an example of multilevel inheritance. The code main program is shown below.
```cpp
int main()
{
    Result harry;
    aayush.set_roll_number(420);
    aayush.set_marks(94.0, 90.0);
    aayush.display_results();
    return 0;
}
```
As shown in above Code,

- 1st object “aayush” is created of the “Result” data type.
- 2nd the function “set_roll_number” is called by the object “aayush” and the value “420” is passed.
- 3rd the function “set_marks” is called by the object “aayush” and the values “94.0” and “90.0” are passed.
- 4th the function “display_results” is called by the object “aayush”.
# Multiple Inheritance:
## Multiple Inheritances in C++
Multiple inheritances are a type of inheritance in which one derived class is inherited with more than one base class. For example, we have three classes “employee”, “assistant” and “programmer”. If the “programmer” class is inherited from the “employee” and “assistant” class which means that the “programmer” class can now implement the functionalities of the “employee” and “assistant” class. The syntax of inheriting multiple inheritances is shown below.
```cpp
// class DerivedC: visibility-mode base1, visibility-mode base2
// {
//      Class body of class "DerivedC"
// };
```
- After writing the class keyword we have to write the derived class name and then put a “:” sign.
- After “:” sign we have to write the visibility mode and then write the base class name and again we have to write the visibility mode and write another base class name.
An example program is shown below to demonstrate the concept of multiple inheritances in C++.
```cpp
class Base1{
protected:
    int base1int;

public:
    void set_base1int(int a)
    {
        base1int = a;
    }
};

class Base2{
protected:
    int base2int;

public:
    void set_base2int(int a)
    {
        base2int = a;
    }
};

class Base3{
protected:
    int base3int;

public:
    void set_base3int(int a)
    {
        base3int = a;
    }
};
```
As shown in above Code,

- 1st we created a “Base1” class which consists of protected data member integer “base1int”.
- 2nd the “Base1” class consists of a public function “set_base1int”. This function will set the value of the data member “base1int”.
- 3rd we created a “Base2” class which consists of protected data member integer “base2int”.
- 4th the “Base2” class consists of a public function “set_base2int”. This function will set the value of the data member “base2int”.
- 5th we created a “Base3” class which consists of protected data member integer “base3int”.
- 2nd the “Base3” class consists of a public function “set_base3int”. This function will set the value of the data member “base3int”.
The code for the “Derived” class is shown below. “Derived” class will inherit all the base classes.
```cpp
class Derived : public Base1, public Base2, public Base3
{
    public: 
        void show(){
            cout << "The value of Base1 is " << base1int<<endl;
            cout << "The value of Base2 is " << base2int<<endl;
            cout << "The value of Base3 is " << base3int<<endl;
            cout << "The sum of these values is " << base1int + base2int + base3int << endl;
        }
};
```
As shown in above code,

- 1st we created a “Derived” class which is inheriting “Base1”, “Base2”, and “Base3” classes in public mode.
- 2nd the “Derived” class consists of the public member function “show”.
- 3th the function “show” will first print the values of “base1int”, “base2int”, and “base3int” individually and then print the sum of all three values.
It can be clearly seen that the class “Derived” is inheriting class “Base1”, “Base2”, and “Base3”. This is an example of multiple inheritances. The code main program is shown below.
```cpp
int main()
{
    Derived harry;
    harry.set_base1int(25);
    harry.set_base2int(5);
    harry.set_base3int(15);
    harry.show();
    
    return 0;
}
```
As shown in above Code,

- 1st object “harry” is created of the “Derived” data type.
- 2nd the function “set_base1int” is called by the object “harry” and the value “25” is passed.
- 3rd the function “set_base2int” is called by the object “harry” and the value “5” is passed.
- 4th the function “set_base3int” is called by the object “harry” and the value “15” is passed.
- 5th the function “show” is called by the object “harry”.
